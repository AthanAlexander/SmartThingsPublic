This is a smartthings device handler for the Xiaomi Aqara 2 button wired wall switch with no neutral connection.  
It is based on work by @simic and @wastedabuser. 
Only one of the 2 switches is required to be connected to the live + switched wire.  The other may be used as a soft switch.
The device will also give the temperature (in integer degrees).
The device responds to simple presses of the switch and to press and hold.  It does not respond to double presses.
The additional attribute 'lastPressType' takes the values 'soft', 'hard', 'double', 'held', 'refresh', indicating the type of the last switching event.
'double' indicates that both switches were pressed simulataneously.  
'refresh' indicates that the 'refresh' icopn in the app was pressed.
