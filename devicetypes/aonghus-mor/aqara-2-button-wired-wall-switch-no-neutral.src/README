This is a smartthings device handler for the Xiaomi Aqara 2 button wired wall switch with no neutral connection.  
It is based on work by @simic and @wastedabuser. 
Only one of the 2 switches is required to be connected to the live + switched wire.  The other may be used as a soft switch.
The device will also give the temperature (in integer degrees).
The device responds to simple presses of the switch and to press and hold.  It does not respond to double presses.
The additional attribute 'lastPressType' takes the values 'soft', 'hard', 'double', 'held', 'refresh', indicating the type of the last switching event.
'double' indicates that both switches were pressed simulataneously.  
'refresh' indicates that the 'refresh' icopn in the app was pressed. 

The latest version can now treat the unwired switch as a button, which can be used in conjunction with 
(e.g.) ABC (Advanced Button Controller).
The DH is capable of detecting which switch, if any, is unwired.  
However, I have decided to include a preference for initialising this to 'None', 'Left', or 'Right'.   
The DH can correct this if it is chosen wrongly, but that is unlikely to be necessary.
Note that the button smartapp will only ever see a single button, as one of the switches must be wired 
and behave as a traditional on/off switch.
